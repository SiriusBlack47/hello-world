Here's a paragraph under a footnote. [^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote.
  The topic which I enjoyed most from this course was UNIX and command line. It's interesting how various types of computational biology programs run through this operating system. Also, command line has taught me how accessible it is to run on various forms of OS like Microsoft Windows. Some examples of bioinformatics tools which I've used a few semesters ago were BLAST and FASTA. These tools were utilized for comparing genomic sequences of bacteria for my BIOL 300L at the main campus of UMBC. It provided me insight on how to navigate through the website of NIH plus how to upload FASTA files from SnapGene.
